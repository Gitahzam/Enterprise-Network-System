# Enterprise-Network-System
A CPT based project portraying a stable and fast enterprise network.
This is a computer network, developed on Cisco Packet Tracer, portraying a network of an enterprise. This is a stable and fast network which suits the needs of an enterprise.
Developing and configuring a network can be difficult and another barrier could be the architecture of the network. This network took me 5 days and 4 nights to design and configure. Though this is'nt as complex and charismatic, for a beginner like me it was real difficult. this was the first project I designed,will be doing more Insha Allah.
